## Installation of Flex
One needs a LINUX based system or a WSL or a Virtual Box in order to use Flex. Using Flex in Windows system is strictly prohibited.
The commands to install in `LINUX system` is as follows:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install flex
```
Anyone having trouble compiling flex files with this can install another version of flex:
`sudo apt-get install flex-old`
